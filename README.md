I have a great background in marketing and media.
I have been working in a marketing team for 6 years
I perfectly understand all its processes and metrics.
At the same time, I studied programming (java) and data analytics (at Yandex).
I know SQL (Postgre, MySQL), I can write in Python,
I have experience with Tableu and DataLens,
I have some experience in ML (Catboost).

About myself - I am a workaholic, work brings me, I love to look for points and feelings of growth. At work, with my own team we created a Youtube channel, which gained 3,000 subscribers in a year, I analyzed it, and searched for video topics for relevant key queries. I like to work in the team and bring measurable results.
