I have a great background in marketing and media. I have been working in a marketing team for 6 years, I perfectly understand all its processes and metrics. At the same time, I studied programming (java) and data analytics (at Yandex). I know SQL (Postgre, MySQL), I can write in Python, I have experience with Tableu and DataLens, I have some experience in ML (Catboost).
About myself - I am a workaholic, work brings me, I love to look for points and feelings of growth. At work, with my own team we created a Youtube channel, which gained 3,000 subscribers in a year, I analyzed it, and searched for video topics for relevant key queries. I like to work in the team and bring measurable results.
